# Search frictions and market power in negotiated-price markets
### Allen, Clark and Houde

## Foreplay

- **Negotiated-price markets**
    - Sellers post prices, but actual transaction prices are achieved via bargaining (cars, health insurance, capital assets, B2B)
    - Key features: *search frictions* (cost of gather quotes), *loyatly advantage* (switching cost, complementarities, etc).
    
Note:
Both things have implications for market power. Search costs lead to PD (first seller has almost monopoly power if high costs of search) and brand loyalty reduces (bargaining because incumbents provide higher value thus lock-in happens)
